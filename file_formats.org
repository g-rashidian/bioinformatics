* File Formats and how to work with them
** The FASTA format
FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences
or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using
single-letter codes. The description line (defline) or header line, which begins
with ~>~ gives a name and/or a unique identifier for the sequence, and may also
contain additional information.  After the header line and comments, one or more
lines may follow describing the sequence

Example of fasta file format:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>sequence_name
ACGTGCGTACGTACGTGTGTCGTA
ACGTACGTAAACCGTCGTACGTAC
ACGTGTGTACAGTCGTACAGTACG
#+END_EXAMPLE
