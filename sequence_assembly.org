** main Staden programs: 
*** trev
viewier and editor of trace files
*** pregap4
Pregap is used to process raw traces, hot off the sequencer (although it can be used for text files as
well). It is used to mask all of the sequence you probably don’t want in the final assembly such as bits
of vector and poor quality sequence.
*** gap4
Gap is the Genome Assembly Program – the bit which actually assembles your individual fragments
into long contigs. It allows you to edit the assembly, referring back to the starting traces where they
are present. 


** Data for assembly:

data for assembly are located in =~/Desktop/bioinformatics/data/sanger=
