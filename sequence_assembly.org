** main Staden programs: 
*** trev
viewier and editor of trace files
*** pregap4
Pregap is used to process raw traces. It is used to mask all of low quality
sequences, sequencing primers and vector sequences. 
*** gap4
Gap is the Genome Assembly Program â€“ the program which actually assembles your individual fragments
into long contigs. It allows you to edit the assembly, referring back to the starting traces where they
are present. 


** Data for assembly:

data for assembly are located in =~/Desktop/bioinformatics/data/sanger=
