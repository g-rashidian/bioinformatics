#+TITLE:Searching in Biological Databases
* NCBI databases
** Nucleotide sequence search
Go to NCBI genebank at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=nuccore.
or on main NBCI page switch to *Nucleotide* database
*** Simple search 
- Over thousand results are shown. Go to *Advanced search*
- enter *presenilin 1* in the search box, hit search (If you surround a phrase
  with quotes, that will force Entrez to search it as a /phrase/. If you do not
  surround a phrase with quotes, Entrez will separate the terms with a default
  Boolean AND if the terms do not exist as a phrase in the index of the desired
  field. Press the Details button after a search is done to see how Entrez
  parsed the query)
- In query builder, set new search:
  1. Search for *presenilin 1* in the *Title* field
  2. *human* in the *Organism* field, organism can be selected from pop-up menu
- on page with search results *Search details* shows parameters of the search
- how many records did you  found?
- panel on the right shows available filters - you can restrict your
  search to records from a specific source database, such as the curated
  *RefSeq* database. What results dou you get when you filter your search?
** Reusing previous searches
In advanced search, previous searches are recorded and can be used to build new
queries
** Formating and downloading search results
- Format of the results can be changes from "summary" to FASTA/ FASTA(text), GenBank or other formats. 
- *Send to*  enable saving results to file

** Gene searching: 
go to NCBI website and select "Gene" database. Search for human *presenilin 1*
- what is the gene ID?
- what is the chromosomal location of the gene
# chromosome 14
- how many exon have this genes?
# 14
# show also expression from RNASeq

** Retrieve sequence records that were added or modified between two dates

If a researcher is particularly interested in the sequences associated with a
specific gene or topic, they might do a periodic search to find out what new
data have been added since the last time they searched. If the researcher does
not want to see previously retrieved records, but only records that have been
added to the database or modified since the last time they searched

- go to NCBI and select *nucleotide* database
- go to advanced searched
- search for mouse  *actin* in title
- set required modification date 2019/02/01 to present

# (("Mus"[Organism] OR "Mus musculus"[Organism]) AND actin[Title]) AND
# ("2019/01/01"[MDAT] : "3000"[MDAT])
- alternativelly, release data from filter menu can be used
- other ranges can be used in search too (molecular weight, sequence length,..)
  
#+begin_comment
Range searching on other data elements Range searching can also be done in the
following search fields -- try them in the Entrez CoreNucleotide, Entrez
NucleotideGSS, or Entrez Protein databases, as appropriate/desired. accession
AF114696:AF114714[ACCN] (GSS sequences) sequence length 3000:4000[SLEN]
molecular weight 002002:002009[MOLWT] date 1998/02:2000/01/25[MDAT]

More information on search fields can be found in
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK49540/

** Accessing complete genome
on NCBI web select "Genome" database in resources and search for *Haemophilus
influenzae* ("Haemophilus influenzae"[orgn] )
- how many assemblies is available?
- What assembly levels are available?
- what is the length os reference assembly (NC_000907.1)?
*** downloading assembly data:
data are stored on NCBI ftp server. Files can be downloaded using web browser
but this could be problematic for large datasets. Alternatively, we can use
command line donwload:


#+begin_src bash results: value raw
mkdir ~/Desktop/genome_assembly cd ~/Desktop/genome_assembly
# single file download:
wget
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/002/988/225/GCA_002988225.1_ASM298822v1/GCA_002988225.1_ASM298822v1_genomic.fna.gz
# or download complete directory with assembly:
wget
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCA/002/988/225/GCA_002988225.1_ASM298822v1/*
ls -l #+end_src
#+end_src


*** Assembly levels - NCBI definition
- *Complete genome* - all chromosomes are gapless and have no runs of 10 or more
  ambiguous bases (Ns), there are no unplaced or unlocalized scaffolds, and all
  the expected chromosomes are present (i.e. the assembly is not noted as having
  partial genome representation). Plasmids and organelles may or may not be
  included in the assembly but if present then the sequences are gapless.

- *Chromosome* - there is sequence for one or more chromosomes. This could be a
  completely sequenced chromosome without gaps or a chromosome containing
  scaffolds or contigs with gaps between them. There may also be unplaced or
  unlocalized scaffolds.

- *Scaffold* - some sequence contigs have been connected across gaps to create
  scaffolds, but the scaffolds are all unplaced or unlocalized

- *Contig* - nothing is assembled beyond the level of sequence contigs

* Uniprot

UniProt, http://www.uniprot.org/, consists of three parts:

- UniProt Knowledge-base (UniProtKB) protein sequences with annotation and references
- UniProt Reference Clusters (UniRef) homology-reduced database, where similar
  sequences (having a certain percentage identity) are merged into clusters,
  each with a representative sequence
- UniProt Archive (UniParc) an archive containing all versions of Uniprot without annotations

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot a manually annotated (reviewed) protein-database.
UniProtKB/TrEMBL a computer-annotated supplement to Swiss-Prot, that contains
all translations of EMBL nucleotide sequences not yet included in Swiss-Prot.

** simple search
Open the UniProt home-page http://www.uniprot.org/
Type *human insulin* in the search field in the top of the page. Leave the search
menu on "UniProtKB", which is default. Click the Search button.
- How many hits do you find? (tip: See the number above the results list)
- How many of these hits are from Swiss-Prot? (tip: See under "Reviewed" at the top left)
- Can you identify the correct hit (i.e. see which one is actually human insulin
  and not something else)? If yes, write down is Accession code (found under
  Entry) and Entry name (also called ID).
  # P01308 (INS_HUMAN)

** advanced search 
- go to advanced search menu, query can be build in similar way as in NCBI databases:
- try search "insulin" in protein name filed and "human" in organism field.

** Information included in uniprot record

find in the uniprot record page of human insulin:
- Where in the cell / outside the cell do you find insulin?
- How long is the signal peptide?
- where is the highest expression of insulin
- what organism has the most similar protein to human insulin
  # gorila 	Q6YK33 - according uniref
- go to cross-references section - what types of linked databases you can find?

* Genome assemblies
- Ensembe : https://www.ensembl.org

- View ESTs, clones, mRNA and proteins for any chromosomal region.
- Examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for a gene or
  chromosomal region.
- View SNPs across strains (rat, mouse), populations (human), or
  breeds (dog).
- View positions and sequence of mRNAs and proteins that align with
  Ensembl genes.
- Upload your own data.
- Use BLAST, or BLAT against any genome in Ensembl.
- Export sequences or create a table with gene information using
  BioMart.
- Share Ensembl displays with your colleagues and collaborators
